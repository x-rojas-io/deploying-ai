    "We start with a vector representation of our text data. This can be obtained using tokenization or embeddings, as discussed elsewhere in these notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ If the vectors are identical, then the angle is 0 degrees, and the cosine similarity is 1.\n",
    "+ If the vectors are unrelated, the angle is 90 degrees, and the cosine similarity is 0.\n",
    "+ If the vectors are in opposite directions, the angle is 180 degrees, and the cosine similarity is -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cosine is a trigonometric function that, when applied to any vector, results in a metric that depends on the differences of direction in the vector and not on their magnitude. This is important because it allows us to compare documents of different lengths. \n",
